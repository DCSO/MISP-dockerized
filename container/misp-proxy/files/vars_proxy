#   Proxy Include File
#==============================

# Sets the protocol and address of a proxied server and an optional URI to which a location should be mapped. 
# As a protocol, “http” or “https” can be specified. 
# The address can be specified as a domain name or IP address, and an optional port:
proxy_pass https://misp-server:443;

# Allows redefining or appending fields to the request header passed to the proxied server. 
# The value can contain text, variables, and their combinations. 
# These directives are inherited from the previous level if and 
# only if there are no proxy_set_header directives defined on the current level. 
# By default, only two fields are redefined:
#   proxy_set_header Host       $proxy_host;
#   proxy_set_header Connection close;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";
proxy_set_header Connection "";

# Determines whether SSL sessions can be reused when working with the proxied server. 
# If the errors “SSL3_GET_FINISHED:digest check failed” appear in the logs, 
# try disabling session reuse. Default:
# proxy_ssl_session_reuse on;

# Sets the HTTP protocol version for proxying. 
# By default, version 1.0 is used. 
# Version 1.1 is recommended for use with keepalive connections and NTLM authentication.
proxy_http_version 1.1;

# Defines a timeout for reading a response from the proxied server. 
# The timeout is set only between two successive read operations, not for the transmission of the whole response. 
# If the proxied server does not transmit anything within this time, the connection is closed.
proxy_read_timeout 300;		

# Adds the specified field to a response header provided that the response code equals 
# 200, 201 (1.3.10), 204, 206, 301, 302, 303, 304, 307 (1.1.16, 1.0.13), or 308 (1.13.0). 
# The value can contain variables.
# If the always parameter is specified (1.7.5), the header field will be added regardless of the response code
